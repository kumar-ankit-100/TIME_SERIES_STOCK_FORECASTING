# 📈 Time Series Stock Forecasting

This project focuses on forecasting stock prices using time series analysis and deep learning techniques. It leverages LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

The goal is to build a robust model that learns temporal patterns in stock market data and can provide reliable future predictions. The project is suitable for learning about time series preprocessing, LSTM modeling, and result visualization.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Fetches and processes historical stock data
- 📈 Visualizes stock trends
- 🤖 Builds and trains an LSTM-based neural network
- 🔮 Predicts future stock prices
- 📉 Compares predictions vs actual values

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Yahoo Finance API (via `yfinance`)
